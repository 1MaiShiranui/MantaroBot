### Using the Official Mantaro
[***Click Here. No, seriously. This is the only step to add Mantaro to your Guild!***](https://is.gd/mantaro)

### Building it your own
**Warning**: Both [**@AdrianTodt**](https://github.com/adriantodt) and [**@Kodehawa**](https://github.com/Kodehawa)
don't recommend trying to do this as Mantaro isn't documented in the slightest and some builds here might be extremely unstable.
Also you are going to need at least 3 or 4 API Keys that I ([**@AdrianTodt**](https://github.com/adriantodt))
don't even know how [**@Kodehawa**](https://github.com/Kodehawa) got. _You have been warned_.

#### Konachan notice (net.kodehawa.lib.konachan)
That package is a port of the [**original konachan library**](https://github.com/Mxrck/KonachanLib) to Java 8 and to better suit our needs. I just didn't want to post it on GitHub as a separate lib, but if anyone wants I'll do so.
